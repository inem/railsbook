# Intro

There's a whole bunch of smart people telling us why we shouldn't use Ruby on Rails.
The problem is that it seems those guys are too smart. They use very smart words and high-level concepts, assuming that everybody knows what it means.

But come on, if we would be that smart, we wouldn't even be considering working as another form creator in a million-first Rails app.
We would be flying under the sky with gods, hacking around and moving mountains with the power of Clojure or Erlang.

Remember the day you switched from PHP to Rails. What a pleasure it was! The Chaos has been scattered with The Power of Mighty MVC. Everything had its own place and its own responsibility. What a wonderful feeling it was.

But something went wrong, right? Suddenly it becomes hard to maintain the application, that you crafted with love for months.
And you starting to think that probably something is wrong with you. Probably you need to try harder to follow Rails way. 

Or maybe it was just an accident. In your next Rails application,  everything will be different. You're gonna show those haters, that they are wrong! Rails is awesome! It simplifies my life as a developer!

But time passes, and history repeats. What the f*ck? Am I a shitty developer? I was doing my best and trying so hard!!

Calm down. You're not alone. There is a whole generation of Rails developers like me and you, who are in the same situation.
Sit closer, brother. It is going to take some time.
