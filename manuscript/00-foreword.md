I think this book should have been written in 2011. 
But nobody had written it, and I still see a huge demand for this topic to be covered on conferences and inside people's code. So, this book is finally going to happen.

Moreover, it is good that I started to write in 2015. Because now we already have alternatives to Rails-way approach, like ROM & Lotus.
