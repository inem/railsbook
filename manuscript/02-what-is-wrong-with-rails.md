# What is wrong with Rails

So what about Rails. The worst thing is that Rails itself doesn't have any hints about what to do when your app gets bigger.
Actually, it shouldn't. It is just a framework. So we have this basic understanding where to put our stuff. It makes sense

But rails applications become big pretty quick.

There's a bunch of sites containing Rails best practices, but lots of the advises are trying to fix symptoms, not the root problem.
